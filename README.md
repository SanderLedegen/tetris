# Tetris

## Description
A JavaScript tetris clone of which there already exist a gazillion. The only difference is that I made this one.

I tried to keep close to the original colours, scoring system and board dimensions while making it
possible to play it on both desktops and mobiles. Should be fun to kill some time on the toilet ðŸ’©

## How to play
On devices that have a keyboard you can use the arrow keys and spacebar. On touchscreen devices, you can go along
by swiping, tapping and pressing the screen. 

### Keyboard
`Left/Right` - moves a piece left and right

`Up` - rotate

`Down` - soft drop

`Spacebar` - hard drop

### Touchscreen
`Swipe left/right` - moves a piece left and right

`Swipe down` - soft drop

`Tap` - rotate

`(Longer) press` - hard drop

## Known limitations/bugs
- You can always rotate a piece even when it should not be possible.

## Future plans
- Implement correct scoring.
- Revise the canvas renderer for both desktop and mobile (portrait and landscape).
